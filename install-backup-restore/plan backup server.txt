based on backup-homelab_old.sh (I just renamed it _old) adapt the backup script to be compatible with my new "architectuire" :
/mnt/Storage on casaOs holds
- a directory /DATA : the casaOS /DATA directory with /AppData and /Media etc
- a directory /backup : destination folder of the backup we are going to create/restore

The previous backup script was using an external hdd. and copied a lot of stuff, maybe too much.
Now that I am using the /mnt/Storage  hard drive and using symlink between its /DATA and the /DATA of casaOS used by the containers,
we no longer need to backup the enitre casaOS /DATA directory
(because if I wipe the ubuntu or mess with casaOS, I can just replug the /DATA after install to the /mnt/Storage/DATA).

In the mnt/Storage/DATA we need to backup the /AppData only (and not the /Media if it was the case)

I need a script to backup:
1) the /mnt/Storage/DATA/AppData into /mnt/Storage/backup/DATA/AppData
2) the / (root) into /mnt/Storage/backup/homelab (do you suggest a better directory name ?)

And a second scrypt that would :
1) restore the /home and /srv folder from /mnt/Storage/backup/homelab into / (root) of the server
2) restore the /backup/DATA/AppData into the mnt/Storage/DATA/AppData
	- step 2 need some rules, help me identify good practices here:
	- do not copy file if it already exists

For those I suggest we use rsync.
The backup needs to be executed by cron every sunday to monday nigh (so every monday at 5am is good choice)
so when backup script is finish, create a new .mùd file with instructions to save the script in the server and the comand for the cron
